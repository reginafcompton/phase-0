// Reflection
// What JavaScript knowledge did you solidify in this challenge?

// I feel increasingly more competent in JS syntax, especially building loops with counters.
// I learned, particularly, about putting objects inside of arrays, something that came up in earlier exercises, but did not really stick until today.



// What are constructor functions? How are constructors different from Ruby classes (in your research)?

// A constructor function provides one way to create a JS object (the other way â€“ literal notation).
// A construction function allows you to create multiple instances of an object.
// Fundamentally, it resembles a class, which provides the blueprint for a Ruby object, including many of the objects "abilities" and behaviors, or methods.
// JS, however, seems more restrictive about passing variables from function-to-function, whereas Ruby has options: class variable, instance variables, and global variables.
