// Eloquent JavaScript
//INTRODUCTION
// I appreciate Haverbeke's discussion of programming as "many things."
// He addresses a interesting point: a program is data, stored in the computer's memory,
// but also the program is a force that controls data.

// CHAPTER 1
// At the fundamental level, JS and Ruby are remarkably similar.
// Both languages have the following "values" (i.e., chunks that represent pieces of data): numbers, strings, booleans, objects, functions, and undefined values.
// The languages can create and manipulate these values.
// In Ruby and JS, for example, a program can perform arithmetic operations by adding, subtracting, multiplying (etc.) integers and floats.
// Oddly, JS allows for great flexibility; a JS program, unlike Ruby, will silently convert values, so that an
// otherwise problematic code functions correctly.
// For example, if I were to add a string ("8") with an integer (2), JS will convert the integer to a string and concatenate the values ("82").
// A less forgiving, more ornery language, Ruby will raise an error.
