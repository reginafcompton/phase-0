      <h1>Before the Sn@il</h1>
      <p>The Italian word <em>chiocciola</em> literally translates as "snail," a passive, sluggish creature that hides in gardens and loves the rain. Perhaps somewhat oddly, <em>chiocciola</em> also describes the @ symbol, a modern emblem of speed, efficiency, and technology. Though an apparent contradiction, the Italian "snail" in fact embodies the spirit of a quick, tech-driven world, in that great ideas come from slow, deliberate, snail-like action.</p>

      <p>This website celebrates the unique identity that precedes this strange nomenclature: the person "before the snail." Specifically, this website showcases projects and writing by Regina Compton, an emerging software engineer, who embraces the "chiocciola" in both its slowness and its speed.</p>
