<!--
What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

The big take away from this lesson: learning how to add Sublime snippets and update existing ones. It took some time to get the TAB function working, but now I am happy to have the improved shortcut. I do plan to add others as I sharpen my coding skills; first, I'd like to add a snippet for making lists. (In fact, I recently added a "build-system" preview for HTML on Chrome.)

I partitioned the body of my website with three tags: <header>, <main>, and <footer>. Then, I used <div> tags to demarcate smaller sections â€“ however, I might make these <section> tags instead.

My guide recommended a website for study (www.tastytrade.com), one that he recently helped to launch. He used <section> tags throughout, so I may do something similar.
