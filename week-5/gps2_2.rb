# What did you learn about pseudocode from working on this challenge?

=begin
Pseudocode can contain myriad details, even for the simplest of operations.

# What are the tradeoffs of using Arrays and Hashes for this challenge?

=begin
Arrays give an ordered list of objects. That is, the objects appear in a
linear order, according to index numbers. This could be useful, if your grocery list needed to appear in a particular numerical order.
(Each item in the array could give the grocery item and its quantity, e.g, ["4 tomatoes", "7 carrots"]).
Hashes, however, give a list of "keys" and "values": to access each item, you refer to its key or value, not index number.
Though not ordered numerically, a hash provides an easy way to
create, update, and remove individual keys and/or values.

# What does a method return? What kind of things can you pass into methods as arguments? How can you pass information between methods?

=begin
A method executes a code and returns its value, which could be a
string, integer, float, array, etc. Likewise, you can pass any number of things into a method: a string, integer, float, array, etc.
You can pass information between methods by giving their arguments the
same labels and also by assigning variable(s) that other methods
can access (e.g., "grocery_list = {}").
=end

# What concepts were solidified in this challenge, and what concepts are still confusing?

=begin
I fully understand how to assign a variable outside a method or collection of methods. If I wish to integrate this variable into my method, then I must
include a parameter for it. For example, in add_list(list, item, price), the
argument "list" may refer to a hash (or array or whatever) that is assigned outside the method itself. When I call the method add_list, I pass the name of my assigned hash (or array or whatever) into it.
My guide also explained how to define classes â€“ an incredibly useful lesson!
I understand the fundamentals of classes, though I imagine that they can become rather complex beasts.
