=begin
I used the .sort and .sort_by methods. The array contains both integers and
strings, so I needed to account for this. In my initial solution, I added a
comparator with .to_s converters in the block. The .to_s converts the integer,
allowing comparison of the two objects. I then refactored this solution.
I used .sort_by, a method that assumes that I want to compare two items â€“
hence I do not need the explicit comparator, though I do need the conversion.
The hash sorter is very similar. I used the .sort_by method, and in the block
I indicated that each item in the hash should be sorted by its value. The
.sort_by method returns an array of "array pairs."
