# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.

=begin
I used the .sort and .sort_by methods. The array contains both integers and
strings, so I needed to account for this. In my initial solution, I added a
comparator with .to_s converters in the block. The .to_s converts the integer,
allowing comparison of the two objects. I then refactored this solution.
I used .sort_by, a method that assumes that I want to compare two items â€“
hence I do not need the explicit comparator, though I do need the conversion.
The hash sorter is very similar. I used the .sort_by method, and in the block
I indicated that each item in the hash should be sorted by its value. The
.sort_by method returns an array of "array pairs."

# Reflect!
# What did you learn about researching and explaining your research to others?

=begin
I enjoyed completing the problems on my own, then checking them against
the solutions given by my peers. (Admittedly, I did these exercises at
the end of the week, so I felt significantly more comfortable with
innumerable methods than I did, say, on Monday.) I did not learn a great
deal about "how to research" for my peers; I think learning of that nature comes with writing blog posts and pairing.
Nonetheless, I did learn from my group, simply by looking at their solutions.
