<strong>REFLECTION</strong>

<em>What is a wireframe?</em> and <em>What are the benefits of wireframing?</em>
A wireframe presents the basic, basic structure of a website. It need not be fancy or overly detailed; it just gives the overall sense of where-things-go. Indeed, a wireframe can be easily sketched with a pen and some paper!


Wireframing is the first healthy step in creating a webpage. It helps the designer, developer, and/or client envision the hierarchy of the webpage. Winnie Lim aptly describes the wireframe as a "blue print," something essential to the creative process: "Like the foundation of a building, it has to be fundamentally strong before you decide whether to give it an expensive coat of paint."

<em>Did you enjoy wireframing your site?</em> and <em>Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?</em>
Yes! I drafted about four wireframes, and I narrowed my options to two. I like both, though I'll likely pick the one that I am most capable of developing with my (still) limited HTML and CSS skills.

<em>What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?</em>
For inspiration, I spent some time examining the websites of celebrities (mainly, musicians: Renee Fleming, Stephanie Blythe, Philippe Jaroussky) and bloggers. I used this website as a resource: http://mashable.com/2010/09/15/creative-blogger-bio-pages/

<em>Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?</em>
Honestly, I am starting to find these reflections a bit tedious. It's a lot of prose production, at which I tend to be very slow. I also do not know if "reflecting," especially in prose, is a good memory tool. Some recent work on memory shows that every time we remember, we actually distort data: one study found that eyewitnesses, who described the physical features of a potential criminal on paper, more regularly misidentified the actual person at a later date. I think Radiolab has an episode about this, though I cannot find the exact segment. Checkout this link: http://www.radiolab.org/story/91569-memory-and-forgetting/
